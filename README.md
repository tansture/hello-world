# hello-world
==============

This is the first repository I made in Git-hub!

Hello, foolish human beings!
I love coding. Although I did not study CS in the university, I keep learning coding myself years and years.
I hope Git-Hub could help me learn more about coding.
Time is over, I have to go back to Mars!
